# BA775 team project
Our project focuses on helping the Massachusetts Department of Transportation analyze car accidents. We will analyze the relationship between the frequency and severity of car accidents in relation to various factors, for example time period, road sections, weather conditions and locations. We will try to understand the patterns of car crashes in MA and what actions could be taken by the massDOT to prevent crashes in the future. In addition, we have joined our data with a Covid dataset to find out the influence of Covid on car crashes. After our analysis, suggestions could be made to the massDOT on ways to prevent accidents based on our conclusions.
